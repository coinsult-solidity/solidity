# About Coinsult
Just like any other software, smart contracts come with security vulnerabilities. Therefore, a smart contract audit is necessary for ensuring that smart contracts are free of any security issues. Also, the audit will show where the smart contract can be optimized to ensure ideal levels of performance.

Furthermore, an audit will provide investor trust as it proves that the contract will perform up to standard and investors of the project will not lose millions of dollars due to an error in the contract. Also, the legitimacy of the project increases after a completed audit. This legitimacy will open doors to being listed on platforms such as CoinMarketCap and Coingecko.

Weâ€™ve been hired by over 85+ blockchain startups and corporations to audit their smart contracts at an affordable cost.
